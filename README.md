## Download

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/CollotsSpot/Ensemble/releases).

## Setup

1. Launch the app
2. Enter your Music Assistant server URL
3. Connect to your server
4. Start playing! Music plays on your phone by default, or swipe down on the mini player to choose a different player.

### Finding Your Server URL

**Important:** You need the **Music Assistant** URL, not your Home Assistant URL.

To find the correct URL:
1. Open Music Assistant web UI
2. Go to **Settings** > **About**
3. Look for **Base URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8095`)

### Home Assistant Add-on Users

If you run Music Assistant as a Home Assistant add-on:
- Use the IP address of your Home Assistant server
- Do **not** use your Home Assistant URL or ingress URL

### Remote Access

For access outside your home network, you'll need to expose Music Assistant through a reverse proxy (e.g., Traefik, Nginx Proxy Manager, Cloudflare Tunnel).

## Requirements

- Music Assistant server (v2.7.0 beta 20 or later recommended)
- Network connectivity to your Music Assistant server
- Android device (Android 5.0+)
- Audiobookshelf provider configured in Music Assistant (for audiobook features)
